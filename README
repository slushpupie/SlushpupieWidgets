Some simple widgets for android.

To use this, you must include it as a library in your project, and you *MUST*
define a string resource (in res/values/strings.xml) for package_ns that 
matches the namespace of your app.  

For example, if your app uses com.example.myapp as the package name, then
you add the following to your strings.xml:

<string name="package_ns">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.example.myapp</string>

Failure to do so will not result in compile time errors, but will result in
run time errors while trying to use the widgets.
